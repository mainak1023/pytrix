# 🐍 Python Practice Projects

Welcome to my Python Playground! This repository contains a collection of simple Python practice projects I've created to improve my coding skills and explore core concepts of the language.

## 📌 What to Expect

Here you'll find small, beginner-to-intermediate level projects that cover topics such as:

- 🧮 Basic syntax & control structures
- 🗃️ Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc.)
- 🔁 Loops & conditional logic
- 🧩 Functions & modules
- 📂 File handling
- 🎲 Mini-games (e.g., Guess the Number, Rock-Paper-Scissors)
- 📊 Basic data analysis scripts
- 🧪 Simple algorithm implementations
